# YOLOV3

This project aims to implement object detection using the YOLOv3 algorithm. YOLOv3 is a state-of-the-art object detection algorithm that is known for its high accuracy and real-time performance.

The codebase involves training a YOLOv3 model on a custom dataset and evaluating its performance on various metrics such as mean average precision (mAP) and mean average recall (mAR). The training process involves fine-tuning the pre-trained weights on the custom dataset to improve the model's ability to detect objects accurately.

Once the model is trained, it is used to detect objects in real-time on video or image input streams. The detected objects are labeled with bounding boxes and their corresponding class labels. The project also involves experimenting with different hyperparameters to optimize the performance of the model.

Overall, this project provides a comprehensive implementation of the YOLOv3 algorithm for object detection, which can be used in various applications such as surveillance, autonomous driving, and robotics.
